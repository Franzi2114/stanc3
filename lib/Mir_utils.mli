val fwd_traverse_statement :
     ('e, 'a) statement
  -> init:'f
  -> f:('f -> 'a -> 'f * 'c)
  -> 'f * ('e, 'c) statement
(**
   A traversal that simultaneously accumulates a state (type 'f) and replaces the
   substatement values from ('a to 'c). Traversal is done in-order but ignores branching,
   e.g., and if's then block is followed by the else block rather than branching.

val vexpr_of_expr_exn : expr_typed_located -> vexpr
(**
   Take a LHS expression from a general expression, throwing an exception if it can't be a
   LHS expression.
*)

val expr_var_set : expr_typed_located -> vexpr Set.Poly.t
(**
   The set of variables in an expression, including inside an index.

   For use in RHS sets, not LHS assignment sets, except in a target term.
*)

val index_var_set : expr_typed_located index -> vexpr Set.Poly.t
(**
   The set of variables in an index.

   For use in RHS sets, not LHS assignment sets, except in a target term
*)

val expr_assigned_var : expr_typed_located -> vexpr
(**
   The variable being assigned to when the expression is the LHS
*)
